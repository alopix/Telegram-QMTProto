MTProto core Qt library
==========
Quite simple Qt implementation of [Telegram](http://telegram.org)'s [Mobile Transport protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto).

This first version is basically a Qt port from the official [Java implementation](https://github.com/ex3ndr/telegram-mt).
If it works out, fine. If not there's a need to start from scratch for a v2 ;).

Dependencies
----------
* [TLCore](https://github.com/alopix/Telegram-QTLCore) library
